# Magic the Gathering Card Organizer

This app lets you manage and keep track of your Magic the Gathering (MtG) cards. With a simple, user-friendly interface, you can add, view, and remove your cards from a SQLite database.

## Features

- **Add cards**: Enter your card details, including name, expansion, rarity, language, and quantity.
- **View cards**: Check out all your added cards in a neat table.
- **Remove cards**: If you made a mistake or got rid of a card, no worries! Just delete it.

## What You'll Need

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` for the user interface.
- `sqlite3` for database stuff.
- `Pillow` if you want to mess with images (or if you add that feature later).

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this folder.
2. Make sure you have everything from the "What You'll Need" list.
3. Run the main file to start the app:
```
python file_name.py
```
(Replace `file_name.py` with the actual name if it's different).

## Possible Upgrades

- **Search for cards**: Adding a search function to find specific cards.
- **Edit cards**: Letting you change card details in the database.
- **Card images**: Adding a feature to see card images.
